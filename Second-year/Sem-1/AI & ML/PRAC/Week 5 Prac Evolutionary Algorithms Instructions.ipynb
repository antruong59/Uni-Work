    "# Practical Week 5: Evolutionary Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical you will implement a simple Genetic Algorithm and apply it on examples. This work is to build your understanding of evolutionary search algorithms and your ability to apply them to examples. This work is not assessed, and you do not need to submit it. Please ask questions if you are facing difficulties with any of the content in this practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms (or GA) are a form of evolutionary algorithm that are inspired by natural evolution. GAs are particularly useful in optimization and search problems with large state spaces that cannot be solved mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a problem, GAs make use of a population of individuals that represent candidate solutions. Each such individual is represented by a chromosome that encodes the candidate solution in the form of genes, such that the candidate solution can be reconstructed from the corresponding chromosome. GAs work in iterations, where a new population is generated from the previous population in each iteration. This process is guided by a fitness function, which captures the quality of a candidate solution. GAs use operations such as crossover and mutation to generate new individuals from their \"parent\" individuals. This process relies on a competitive selection process that aims to identify good chromosome building blocks that occur frequencly in good candidate solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A genetic algorithm works in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Initialize random population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Calculate population fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Select individuals for mating.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Mate selected individuals to produce new population. There is a random chance that individuals in the new population will be mutated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Repeat from step 2) until an individual is fit enough or the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",

    "## Activity 1: Map Colouring Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will implement the Australia Map Colouring Problem we have discussed in a previous week in the course. In this problem, we shall assign one of three colours to each region (state or territory) on the Australia Map such that adjacent regions are assigned different colours. We will ignore the Australian Capital Territory, and simply consider the following regions: \n",
    "\n",
    "`WA`, `SA`, `NT`, `Q`, `NSW`, `VIC`, and `TAS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not yet completed the Workbook exercises for this week, please examine them before attempting this practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must define how to encode candidate solutions as chromosomes. Here, we will simply fix the order of the regions as described above and store the corresponding colour for each region in a list. For example, the candidate solution where WA is red, SA is blue, NT is green, Q is red, NSW is green, VIC is green, and TAS is red would be encoded as the list `[red, blue, green, red, green, green, red]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined a representation, it is time to define a fitness function. We will use a standard approach to fitness, where larger values of fitness indicate better individuals. For the map colouring problem, we can achieve this by counting how many adjacent territories have different colors. There are 9 shared boundaries, hence, the best fitness is 9 and the worst possible fitness of an individual is 0.\n",
