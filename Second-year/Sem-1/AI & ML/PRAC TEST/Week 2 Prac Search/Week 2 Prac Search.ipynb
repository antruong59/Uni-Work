    "## ACTIVITY 1. BREADTH-FIRST TREE SEARCH\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have understood the basics of defining a problem and visualising it, we can look at the different serach algorithms that we can use to solve the problems. \n",
    "We have learned about several search strategy, such as breadth-first, depth-first, and best-first search strategies for trees and graphs. Recall that tree search methods don't remember which states have already been visited, whereas graph search algorithms take extra effort to detect that revisiting such a state is redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will implement some of them and visualise how they traverse the state space defining the problem to be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by considering tree search methods, in particular, the Breadth First Tree Search algorithm. Recall that this algorithm constructs a search tree starting at the initial state by exploring the search space level-by-level (where levels are distinguished by the number of actions that are applied to reach a state in the level from the initial state).\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorith relies on a data structure, the **frontier**, that contains the states that have been reached but not yet explored. As the search progresses, a state is removed from the frontier, explored, and the successors in the next level that are reachable from the current state are added to the frontier for later processing. The search stops once a goal state has been reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall algorithm can be summarised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. return if the initial state is a goal state\n",
    "2. initialise the frontier with the initial state\n",
    "3. Retrieve a node from the frontier.\n",
    "4. Append each node that is reachable from the current node to the frontier, unless the node represents a goal state\n",
    "5. If a goal node is encountered, return a solution\n",
    "6. Repeat from 3. until the frontier is empty or a solution has been found\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, starting the search in the initial state `Arad`, there are three locations that are reachable by using a single action: `Timisioara`, `Sibiu`, and `Zerind`. Hence, the algorithm would first visit Arad, then (in any order) these three states. Then, the states that are directly reachable form these three: `Oradea`, `Fagaras`, `Rimnicu`, `Lugoj`, and `Arad`. `Arad` is considered again, since the algorithm does not keep track of which states have already been visited. This process continues until the path to the goal is found: `Arad`, `Sibiu`, `Fagaras`, `Bucharest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve a level-wise traversal of the search tree, the current state to be explored is retrieved from the start of the frontier, whereas the successors of the explored states are appended at the end of the frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code fragment below shows the overall outline of an implementation of the Breadth-First Tree Search Algorithm. This implementation contains some extra code that records the paths and nodes that are visited during the search. We will use the recorded information to visualise the search progress later.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the code below, the data structure for the fontier are still missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose a Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Your fist hands-on activity is to choose a suitable data structure for the frontier and complete the implementation below.\n",

While this may be tolerable for a small graph such as the Romania map, for larger problems such redundant explorations can mean our algorithm may run for hours or days instead of seconds. We should adopt graph-search for this problem. Recall that the main difference between Tree Search and Graph Search is that the latter keep additional information so that it can detect if a state has already been visited. If that is the case, then no node will be added for that state to the frontier, which prevents the redundant work (at the expense of increasing the memory footprint of the algorithm.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Breadth-First search can be useful if we are seeking the solution with smallest number of actions. However, for many scenarios, we are looking to find a solution that minimises some other metric, such as costs. In the Romania map example, we are seeking to find the shortest path (that minimises the total distance travelled) from `Arad` to `Bucharest`. To achieve this, we must take into consideration the costs associated with each edge in the graph.\n",

    "2) The costs associated with nodes in the frontier may need to be revised, since a node may be superseded by a subsequent node that ends in the same state yet has lower associated costs.\n",
    "3) The \"shortcut\" that we can stop searching once a goal node is encountered during expansion of a node is no longer valid. We must search until a goal node has become the current visited node, that is, until a goal node has been **retrieved** from the frontier.\n",

We can also observe that the same states are explored multiple times. Obviously, the nodes near the root of the tree are traversed for almost every limit value. Moreover, the same states are visited multiple times even within a single depth-limited search. For example, `Timisoara` is visited three times in the last search. While this may seem inefficient, this approach has a significant advantage that the frontier remains small throughout the search. Its size is proportional to the search depth, which can be a big advantage if other algorithms, such as Best-First Search, run out of memory while keeping the frontier and explored set. The idea of iteratively increasing the depth limit can of course be combined with graph search ideas to limit the amount of redundant work that is performed in each iteration. There are also variants of this that work with cost thresholds rather than depth limits, for example RBFS (see the textbook if you are interested)."
